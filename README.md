Applied Bayesian Model Averaging with the Tabu search algorithm.
Modified the bnlearn package in R to start from different random structures (say 200)
Modified the package to exclude the penalty term from the BIC score of each graph, and compute the Log_Likelihood correspondent to the graph
Calculate the mean value over the Log_Likelihood to find the weight of all tested graphs
